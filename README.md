[Personal Github Repository Front Page](https://github.com/Ben-Hilger/Ben-Hilger)

* This page is designed to showcase and allow for easy access to my varius projects for everyone to see, learn and provide feedback on how I can imporve my code

[Client Front End Interface with REST PHP Backend (Javascript, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, PHP, SQL, Amazon Web Servcies, Ubuntu, REST)](https://github.com/Ben-Hilger/Client-Front-End-Interface)

* Developed for CSE 383 final, this website is a front end interface that allows the user to interact with various API's in a user friendly way.
* First tab displays basic information about the design of the website.
* Second tab allows for the user to perform basic calculator operations (+ - * /) between two numbers. Makes an AJAX call with a backend server to perform the calculation and returns the result. Can handle divide by 0 errors.
* Third tab gets a basic 7-day forecast based on a specified zipcode and displays the information in an elegant table format. Makes AJAX calls to get the lat/long of the zip code and then calls the openweatherdata api to get the required weather information.
* Fourth tab allows the user to update a database with new sensor readings. Allows the user to select the sensor and specify a location and value and it then makes an AJAX call to a REST server that would add data to the SQL database running on an AWS instance.
* Fifth tabs allows the user to create a sensor report that pulls the most recent sensor readings from the SQL database. Allows the user to specify the number of sensors to include. Makes an AJAX call to a REST server which will pull the sensor information from the database.

[Covid Ohio Shiny App Dashboard (R/R-Shiny)](https://github.com/Ben-Hilger/STA-404-Covid-Shiny-App)

* Developed for STA 404 final, displays different aspects of COVID data similar to the COVID dashboard.
* Includes graphs such as a choropleth map of Ohio and bar charts comparing different repsonses among counties and age groups. It also has tabs of bar graphs showing the counts and rates of different respsonses as they change over time throughout the pandemic.
* Data pulled from Ohio government and census population website

Movie Database Website (HTML/CSS/Javascript)

* Developed as a website that would display/sort a list of movies from a database.
* Architected back-end with JavaScript and Google's Firebase platform. Front-end with HTML/CSS. Version Control with GitHub
* Helped develop, and implement user email/password login and admin permissions for adding movies to the list. Implemented user permissions to request movies be added to the list

Edge Database (Swift/Kotlin)

* Developed as a communication platform for coaches and players
* Allows coaches to create teams, drills and lesson plans. Also allows coaches to invite players and assign them homework/drills. Also provides students with the ability to view videos of each drill
* Architected with Google's Firebase, Kotlin Multi-platform Library. Version Control with GitHub
